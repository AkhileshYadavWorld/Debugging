If our program has no compile-time errors, it’ll run. This is where the fun really starts.

Errors which happen during program execution (run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. Run-time errors occur when a program with no compile-time
errors asks the computer to do something that the computer is unable to reliably do.

Some common run-time errors:

Division by zero also known as division error
Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist
There is no way for the compiler to know about these kinds of errors when the program is compiled.

Here’s an example of a run-time error message:
int width = 0;
int length = 40;
    
int ratio = length / width;
